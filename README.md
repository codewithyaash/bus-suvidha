Here i created a ticket booking part for bus suvidha website using html,css,php,mysql
This HTML file constitutes the front-end code for a fictional bus service company named "Bharat Bus Services." The code presents a user interface for travelers to interact with various features offered by the company.

Key Features:

Header Section: Displays a marquee with the company name and a slogan encouraging users to travel with the company. Also includes a dropdown menu allowing users to select between different bus categories (A/C and Non A/C).

Bus Route Section: Provides a timetable displaying the routes along with their departure timings. Routes include destinations such as Sambhaji-nagar, Jalna, Parbhani, Hingoli, and Nanded.

Feedback Form Section: Enables users to enter their personal details (full name, age, gender, mobile number), select the source and destination for their journey, and specify the start date. This information is likely intended for booking tickets or gathering feedback from customers.

Contact Section: Provides contact information for customer support, including email and phone number.

Footer: Displays copyright information indicating the year and the company name.

Styling:

The styling of the webpage primarily involves setting background colors, font styles, and layout arrangements to enhance visual appeal and readability.
CSS styles are applied to different elements such as headers, tables, forms, buttons, and sections to maintain consistency and improve user experience.
Note:

This code represents the front-end implementation only and does not include any back-end functionality for processing user inputs or managing bus reservations.
Additional server-side scripting and database integration would be necessary to make the feedback form functional and enable online booking services.
Contributors:

This code was authored by an unnamed developer or team associated with Bharat Bus Services.
Version Control:

This code can be version-controlled using Git to track changes and collaborate with other developers effectively.



This PHP script serves as the backend functionality for handling form submissions from the HTML code provided earlier. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

Session Start: Initiates a PHP session to enable session-based data persistence.

Database Connection Parameters: Defines parameters for connecting to the MySQL database where user reservation data will be stored.

Connection Establishment: Establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the provided connection parameters.

Form Submission Handling: Checks if the form has been submitted via POST request. If so, it sanitizes and escapes user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks. Then, it constructs an SQL query to insert the user's reservation data into the database.

Query Execution: Executes the SQL query to insert the data into the database. If the insertion is successful, the script redirects the user to a "ticket.php" page, passing along the submitted form data as URL parameters. If an error occurs during the insertion process, an error message is displayed.

Connection Closure: Closes the database connection to free up server resources.

This script should be saved as a PHP file (e.g., "reservation.php") and included in the same directory as the HTML file containing the form. It should be configured to work with your specific database setup, including updating the database connection parameters (servername, username, password, dbname) as necessary. Additionally, ensure that the "ticket.php" page exists and is appropriately configured to handle the passed URL parameters.
